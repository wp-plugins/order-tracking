= How do I add the tracking form to the front-end? = 

You can add an order form by putting the following shortcode on whatever page you’d like your tracking form to be: [tracking-form].
= What attributes does the [tracking-form] shortcode accept? =

You can specify the label for the field and the value of the submit button with the attributes ‘order_field_text’ and ‘submit_text’ respectively.
= How do I customize the tracking form? = 
 
There is a text area where you can add Custom CSS to customize the form in “Settings” under “Options”.

Yes, under “Options” you can set the Timezone for your orders.

= What are the columns for the spreadsheet and is it possible to add more information? =

There's no way to display additional information about an order other than by using the "Public Notes" at the moment.The columns that can be uploaded currently are:

Number, Name, Status, Display, Public Notes, Private Notes, Email.

= Is it possible to delete data of an incorrect order completely? =
If you click the checkbox beside the incorrect order and select "Delete" that should get rid of the order.
= Is it possible to change the position of the status to show only the most recent? =
It's not currently possible to load only the most recent status, but we’re keeping this in mind as a future feature.
= How do I translate the plugin into my language? =
A great place to start learning about how to translate a plugin is at the link below: <http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/how-to-translate-a-wordpress-plugin>

Once translated, you'll need to put the translated mo- and po- files directly in the lang folder and make sure they are named properly for your localization.
If you do translate the plugin, other users would love to have access to the files in your language. You can send them to us at Contact@EtoileWebDesign.com, and we’ll be sure they’re included in a future release.
= How do I change the title of “Order Form Instructions”? =
You can edit “Order Form Instructions” on the “Options” page. They can also be set as an attribute, instructions set as an attribute will take priority.
= How do I change the label “Order Number”  field to, for example, “Job Number” in the front end display? =
To change the label, try adding these attributes into your shortcode:
[tracking-form order_field_text='Job Number' field_names='Order Number=>Job Number']

= Is there a way to modify multiple field labels? = 

You can change multiple names by separating them with a comma. 

= My order graph is not displaying properly, all of the statuses are overlapping. How do I fix this? =

Make sure that you set the column “Percentages” on the order statuses page. If the problem persists you can also try editing the spacing using CSS on the “Options” page in the “Custom CSS” box.
